# Carla Self Driving Car System Integration Project
## Team Dragon

### Installation
It is probably easiest to install ROS and deploy everything with Docker, and although you could use the VM provided by Udacity [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/Udacity_VM_Base_V1.0.0.zip), it is recommended to deploy using Docker.

Clone the repository on your host OS to your PWD
```bash
cd $PWD/Dragon
```
If you do not have Docker, feel free to install Docker for your host OS.
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/Dragon -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

Source the ROS env variables. (Change Kinematic to Indigo if using 14.04)
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source /Dragon/ros/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Clone this project repository

Install python dependencies
```bash
cd /Dragon
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make and run nodes
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
```

At this point, exit bash on Docker or proceed to Run steps [below](#);

#### How to "SSH" into your Docker container

> Note that for every new bash session if you are SSH-ing into the Docker container, you should open a new session and use the docker exec command.

```bash
docker ps
```
You can choose to grep the container ID or name and pipe it into the exec command directly or just use the clipboard to copy and paste
```bash
docker exec -it <container name or id> /bin/bash
cd /Dragon/ros
```
This will successfully get you a new bash window to the container where your ros environment resides.

--------

### Run ROS alongside the simulator
After intalling successfully, and run below respectively.
```bash
roscore
```
```bash
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```

-------


### Running the Traffic Light detection standalone
1. Open 2 different bash shells
2. In both bash windows do the following. (If you have installed with the instructions above, skip this step.)
```bash
cd Dragon/ros
source devel/setup.bash
```
3. In window 1,
```bash
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. In window 2,
```bash
roslaunch tl_detector tl_detector.launch
```

### How to test dbw

In order to test dbw, you need to download the ros.bag file and save it to the $PWD/Dragon/data directory
```bash
cd /Dragon/data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YYYYY‚Äù https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/0B2_h37bMVw3iT0ZEdlF4N01QbHc?alt=media -o udacity_succesful_light_detection.bag
mv udacity_succesful_light_detection.bag dbw_test.rosbag.bag
```

After downloading and renaming the file,
```bash
cd ../ros
roslaunch twist_controller dbw_test.launch
```

This will save 3 csv files which you can process to figure out how your DBW node is
performing on various commands.


`/actual/*` are commands from the recorded bag while `/vehicle/*` are the output of your node.
